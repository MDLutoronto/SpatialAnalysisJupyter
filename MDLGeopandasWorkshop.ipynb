This entails installing and importing a variety of software/packages needed for any analysis of interest, including the main Python software. There are many ways a user can do this, but this workshop will focus on using UofT's JupyterHub.\n",

    "The JupyterHub already has the conda package manager setup - but you may need to install additional packages.\n",
